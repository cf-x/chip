## 🔍 Introduction

This repository accompanies the paper **"Robust In-Bed Human Pose and Shape Estimation from Pressure Images with Clinical Awareness"**.  
We propose a novel pipeline that jointly considers pressure sensing and clinical relevance to improve robustness in in-bed human pose and shape estimation.

## ⚖️ RW-MPJPE Weights

To address the **clinical importance of different joints** in evaluating pose accuracy, we introduce **RW-MPJPE (Risk-Weighted MPJPE)**.  
- The weighting schema was defined by ICU nurse experts.  
- Full details of the weights are provided in [RW-MPJPE-weights.md](RW-MPJPE-weights.md).
