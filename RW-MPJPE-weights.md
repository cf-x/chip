## üßæ Background

Standard **MPJPE (Mean Per Joint Position Error)** treats all joints equally.  
However, in clinical in-bed monitoring, **pressure ulcers** vary across body parts.  
Therefore, we propose **RW-MPJPE (Risk-Weighted MPJPE)**, incorporating **nurse-assigned weights** to reflect clinical importance.

## üìê Definition

RW-MPJPE is defined as:

$$
\text{RW-MPJPE} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \cdot d_i}{\sum_{i=1}^N w_i}
$$

Where:
- $d_i$ = per-joint position error (mm)  
- $w_i$ = weight assigned by ICU nurse experts  
- $N$ = total number of joints
